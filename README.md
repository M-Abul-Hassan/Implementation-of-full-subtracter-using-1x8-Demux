# Implementation-of-full-subtracter-using-1x8-Demux
A full subtractor using a 1x8 Demultiplexer is a digital circuit that performs binary subtraction with borrow, using a 1x8 Demultiplexer and basic logic gates. The circuit takes three binary inputs, A, B, and Bin, and produces two binary outputs, D (difference) and Bout (borrow).
